                <div id="faq1" class="faq-content">A: When searching for the <a href=" https://www.gstattoogroup.com/book-online "style="color: aqua;">Best Body Piercing Shop Near Me</a> or simply a reliable Body Piercing Shop, it’s important to look beyond flashy storefronts or social media hype. A professional piercing shop should prioritize safety, hygiene, and client education. The use of sterile, single-use needles is critical—especially when compared to outdated piercing guns, which can damage tissue and are difficult to sterilize properly.

            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button onclick="toggleFAQ('faq2', this)">Q2: How long does a nose piercing take to heal, and when can I change the jewelry <span>?</span></button>
                <div id="faq2" class="faq-content">A: Healing times for nose piercings can vary depending on your body, placement, and aftercare routine. Generally, a standard nostril piercing takes about 2 to 4 months to heal, while septum piercings may heal slightly faster—often in 6 to 8 weeks. However, full internal healing can take up to 6 to 9 months, especially if the area is bumped, twisted, or exposed to harsh products.
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button onclick="toggleFAQ('faq3', this)">Q3: Is getting your ears pierced with a gun safe, or should you use a needle <span>?</span></button>
                <div id="faq3" class="faq-content">A: One of the most common questions clients ask when looking for the Best Ear Piercing or Ear Piercing Near Me is whether to use a <a href=" https://www.google.com/maps?cid=12101863887528811427 "style="color: aqua;">piercing gun</a> or a needle. While piercing guns are often found in mall kiosks or jewelry stores, they’re not considered safe by most professional piercers. The blunt force of a piercing gun can cause unnecessary trauma to the tissue, leading to swelling, pain, and slower healing. </div>
